Introduction
===============

This document contents relative to this add-on.

Requirements
=============

This add-on has been reimplemented due to an issue appeared in Spring 3.0.1GA
(https://jira.springsource.org/browse/SPR-7077). Looks like old way to register property editors
globally doesn't work. Right now the solution is to use methods annotated with @InitBinder in order
to register custom editors.

In the first release of this revisited add-on, it have to register StringTrimmerEditor for all the
Controllers, or one provided.

When the command ``web mvc binding stringTrimmer`` is issued, the add-on will annotate all the classes
annotated with @Controller with @GvNIXStringTrimmerBinder(emptyAsNull=true). This triggers the generation
of an ITD with the method initStringTrimmerBinder annotated with @InitBinder. This method registers
StringTrimmerEditor

Operations
===========

web mvc binding stringTrimmer [--class path_to_controller] [--emptyAsNull true|false]
-----

Performs the needed operations for match the requirements described above.

TODO
====

In future versions of this add-on it would support, at least, Spring Editors listed in

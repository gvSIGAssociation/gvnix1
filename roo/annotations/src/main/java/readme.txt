Please do not create any source files in the "annotation" module.

The "annotation" module is automatically built during compilation. It
contains various files copied from other modules. The src/main/java/org
directory is excluded from SVN and explicitly deleted on each run.

If you need to edit files currently appearing under src/main/java/org,
please do so in the original source module for that file.

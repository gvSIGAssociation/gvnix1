You have previously accepted the Spring User Agent Analysis (UAA) Terms of Use
as displayed at http://www.springsource.org/uaa/terms_of_use. There is also a
FAQ available at http://www.springsource.org/uaa/faq.

This means that all Spring Roo download functions are enabled. All applicable
add-on discovery and installation commands are fully enabled.

If you'd like to change your mind and revoke your acceptance of the UAA Terms
of Use (and in turn disable Spring Roo features such as add-on support), you
may do so by typing 'download reject terms of use' and pressing ENTER.

If you'd like to keep UAA enabled (and thus all Spring Roo features enabled)
but look at the exact data Spring UAA is sending, please type 'download view'
and press ENTER. You can also fine-tune the level of data that Spring UAA is
sending using the 'download privacy level' command.

Questions on Spring UAA? Please ask us on the Spring Roo Community Forum at
http://forum.springsource.org/forumdisplay.php?f=67. We're happy to help.

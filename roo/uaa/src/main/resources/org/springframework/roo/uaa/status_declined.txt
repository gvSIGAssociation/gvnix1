Spring Roo needs to communicate with VMware-operated domains to download
up-to-date information such as the availability of add-ons that offer extra
Spring Roo features. Other VMware software also needs to communicate in order
to provide some of their features. These downloads include anonymous usage
information that help us better understand how Spring is being used. See
http://www.springsource.org/uaa/terms_of_use for the full Spring User Agent
Analysis (UAA) Terms of Use. There is also an FAQ page available at
http://www.springsource.org/uaa/faq for your convenience.

You have previously used the 'download reject terms of use' command or
rejected the Spring User Agent Analysis (UAA) Terms of Use in another Spring
tool. As a consequence, Spring Roo is unable to download up-to-date details
such as add-on indexes. While you can still use Spring Roo, features
requiring downloads from VMware-operated domains will remain disabled.

You may change your mind and indicate you consent to the Spring User Agent
Analysis (UAA) Terms of Use at http://www.springsource.org/uaa/terms_of_use.
To indicate your consent, please type 'download accept terms of use' and press
ENTER. If you do not consent to the Terms of Use, you do not need to do
anything as your previous rejection of the Terms of Use will remain in effect.

Next steps:

* To enable downloads, type 'download accept terms of use' and press ENTER

* To continue to disable downloads and reminders, do nothing

Spring Roo needs to download resources from VMware domains to improve your
experience. We include anonymous usage information as part of these downloads.

The Spring team gathers anonymous usage information to improve your Spring
experience, not for marketing purposes. For example, we collect anonymous
information about the usage of public Roo add-ons. This lets us offer you 
higher quality add-on search results, highlighting the add-ons which are most
popular in the Roo community. We also use this information to help guide our
roadmap, prioritizing the features most valued by the community and enabling
us to optimize the compatibility of technologies frequently used together.

Please see the Spring User Agent Analysis (UAA) Terms of Use at
http://www.springsource.org/uaa/terms_of_use for more information on what
information is collected and how such information is used. There is also an
FAQ at http://www.springsource.org/uaa/faq for your convenience.

To consent to the Terms of Use, please type 'download accept terms of use' at
the command prompt and press ENTER. If you do not type 'download accept terms
of use' to indicate your consent, Spring Roo add-on discovery features will
not be available and anonymous data collection will remain disabled.

Next steps:

* To enable downloads, type 'download accept terms of use' and press ENTER

* To disable downloads, type 'download reject terms of use' and press ENTER

If you don't type either command, Roo will remind you next time it loads.
